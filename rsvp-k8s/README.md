# Sample RSVP APP

This is a sample RSVP app which is having a frontend and a backend where frontend is using the Python Flask framework and backend is storing the data into MongoDB database.

The original application is build by the CloudYuga team. I am only passing the environment variables at runtime to frontend deployment to get it reflected values on the page homepage.
